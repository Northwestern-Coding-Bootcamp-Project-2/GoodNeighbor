## Description 📝 
---
Good Neighbor is a community-driven service exchange app built with express, sequelize, and handlebars. Users can make requests and message each other, with full login functionality, and requests being grouped by city/town (future versions will utilize a third-party API to search for requests). Users can also save requests to their dashboard so as to refer to them later. Unless a user is logged in, they can only visit the homepage and login/signup pages. The application is deployed to Heroku and uses JawsDB MySQL/ 📝

To use the app on your local machine with dummy data, clone the repository and run npm i-y and make a .env file with the relevant values so the app can communicate with your MySQL database (goodneighbor_db). Run npm run seed to seed the database with the dummy data, then npm start to start the app. ⌨️
